=> Core Java Introduction
   Core Java refers to the essential building blocks of the Java programming language, forming the backbone for all Java-based development.

=> Why Learn Java?
   Java is widely used in top companies for developing secure and large-scale enterprise applications, offering strong job opportunities due to its popularity and industry demand.

=> Java’s Security and Scalability
   Java enables the creation of fast, secure, and easily scalable applications, making it a preferred choice for web, standalone, and enterprise systems.

   Example: Scaling a Business Application
   When a business grows, its application must handle more users and data; Java’s design allows applications to scale smoothly without major rewrites.

=> Java’s Rich Features
   Java supports object-oriented programming, exception handling, multi-threading, networking, database connectivity, and user interfaces, making it versatile for various software needs.

=> Java as a Language and Platform
   Java is not just a language but a platform because it comes with its own runtime environment (like JVM, JRE, JDK) that allows Java programs to run independently of the underlying operating system.

=> Platform Dependence vs. Independence
   C programs run directly on an operating system and are platform-dependent, meaning code compiled on one OS may not run on another. Java, however, runs on its own installed platform, making it platform-independent.

=> What is a Programming Language?
   Programming languages are sets of rules and syntax that allow humans to give instructions to computers, much like human languages enable communication between people.

=> Translating Human Code to Binary
   Computers only understand binary (0s and 1s), so programming languages use translators (compilers, interpreters) to convert human-readable code into binary instructions.

=> Why Computers Understand Only Binary
   All data in a computer travels as electric signals through wires; these signals have only two states (current or no current), which correspond to 1 and 0 in binary.

=> The Ternary Computer Experiment
   In the 1950s, there was an attempt to build computers using three signal states (ternary), but it failed due to the high cost and complexity of redesigning all hardware components.

=> Importance of Foundational Knowledge and Note-Taking
   Understanding basic concepts and making handwritten notes helps reinforce learning, enables easy revision, and builds a strong foundation for advanced topics.

=> The Value of Starting from Basic
   Learning programming from the ground up, including why computers work the way they do, builds deeper interest and strong conceptual understanding, which is often skipped in fast-paced courses.
